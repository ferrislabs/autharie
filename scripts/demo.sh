   Open http://localhost:${CONSOLE_PORT} and **create an account** on the login page.

   The port matters: it is the one the realm allows a redirect to. 'pnpm dev'
   uses --strictPort so it fails rather than quietly moving to the next free
   port, which would fail later at the identity provider instead. If ${CONSOLE_PORT}
   is taken, re-run with CONSOLE_PORT=5175 and the realm follows.

   Self-registration is on for this realm, and it is the only way in: FerrisKey
   has no admin API for setting another user's password, so an account created
   by Terraform would exist and be unable to log in. Turned off for anything
   that is not a throwaway stack.

   Then create a deployment and watch it land:

     Data planes -> ${DATAPLANE_ID}

   A shared deployment is placed on the data plane above. A dedicated one
   provisions a data plane of its own for the organisation -- against the same
   k3d cluster locally, which is what the local provisioner is for.

   Once a FerrisKey deployment is Running and you have sent it some traffic,
   its logs and traces are searchable from the deployment's own Logs and
   Traces tabs -- Herald ships both to the Quickwit this script just pointed
   it at (http://host.k3d.internal:${QUICKWIT_PORT} from inside the cluster,
   http://localhost:${QUICKWIT_PORT} from here).
