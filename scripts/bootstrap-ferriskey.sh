✅ realm ready

   Control plane:
     AUTH_ISSUER=${ISSUER}

   Herald:
     AUTH_ISSUER=${ISSUER}
     AUTH_CLIENT_ID=herald-service
     AUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=${SECRET}

   Operating the installation (registering data planes, publishing releases):
     OPERATOR_CLIENT_ID=autharie-operator-cli
     OPERATOR_CLIENT_SECRET=${OPERATOR_SECRET}
     OPERATOR_SUBJECT=${operator_user}
     OPERATOR_PEOPLE=${OPERATOR_PEOPLE}

   Console (apps/console/.env):
     VITE_OIDC_ISSUER_URL=${ISSUER}
     VITE_OIDC_CLIENT_ID=console

   The secret is printed rather than written: it belongs in whatever holds your
   secrets, not in the working tree.

   Your own account needs a platform right to see the operator screens. The
   control plane holds those, not this realm: set AUTHARIE_BOOTSTRAP_OPERATOR to
   your subject, or have an operator grant you:
     curl -X PUT "<control plane>/platform/operators/<your-subject>" \\
          -H "Authorization: Bearer <an operator's token>" \\
          -d '{"rights":["view_estate"]}'
