# `apps/console/src/api/api.client.ts` and `api.tanstack.ts` are generated
# files. Nobody edits them by hand -- when the API changes, this is what makes
# the console see the change. Before this script existed the client had drifted
# far enough that `CreateDeploymentRequest` carried five of the API's ten
# fields, and the console silently dropped everything it could not name.
#
# The OpenAPI document is committed too, at the repository root: it is the
# contract between the two halves, and a diff on it is the readable half of a
# regeneration that otherwise moves hundreds of lines of generated TypeScript.

✅ client regenerated

   $(git -C "${REPO_ROOT}" diff --stat -- openapi.json apps/console/src/api | tail -1)

   Review the diff on openapi.json first -- it is the part that says what
   actually changed about the API.
