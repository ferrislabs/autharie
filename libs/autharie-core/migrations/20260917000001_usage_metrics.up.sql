-- One point per deployment per minute, pre-aggregated by the data plane
-- before it ever reaches here -- the storage decision for #91 (V7): roughly
-- 500k rows a month for a hundred instances, which Postgres carries without
-- a second data system. Ports exist so that changes if it stops being true;
-- this table is deliberately the only thing that would move.

-- No surrogate key: identity is (deployment_id, metric, bucket_start), and a
-- second write for the same three is Herald replaying its report window
-- after a restart, not a new fact -- the insert this table is built for does
-- ON CONFLICT on exactly that key and overwrites the value.
