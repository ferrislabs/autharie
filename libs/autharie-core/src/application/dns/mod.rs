//! What DNS reconciliation needs to know, read without an identity to check.
//!
//! Publishing a record is not something a caller asks for -- it follows from
//! a deployment existing and its data plane having an address, the same way
//! purging deleted deployments follows from a retention window rather than a
//! request. The reads below serve that: [`AutharieService::dataplane_gateway_address`]
//! answers "can this one deployment's record be written right now", asked
//! once at placement, and [`AutharieService::dns_targets`] answers "everything
//! that should have a record right now", asked on a sweep. Neither takes an
//! [`autharie_auth::Identity`] for the same reason `purge_deleted_deployments`
//! does not: nobody is the caller, the installation's own upkeep is.
//!
//! Turning what these return into an actual record is `autharie-ovh`'s job,
//! wired in at `autharie-api` -- this crate never holds a `DnsProvider`, the
//! same way it never held an object store or a key manager.
