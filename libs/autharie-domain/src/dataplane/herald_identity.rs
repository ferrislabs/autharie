//! How a data plane proves which data plane it is.
//!
//! Every cluster used to authenticate as the same client, with the same secret,
//! and name the data plane it was acting for in the URL. So the control plane
//! knew it was talking to *a* Herald and took its word for *which* -- which
//! meant one compromised cluster could claim another's work, acknowledge it
//! unfinished, keep a dead cluster eligible for placement, and report a live
//! deployment deleted.
//!
//! A cluster now gets an identity of its own, and the data plane it may speak
//! for is read from that identity rather than from anything it sends.
