//! Fleet-wide signals: outcomes watched by operational probes.
//!
//! A `Signal` is a statement about something that happened or is happening in
//! the fleet, like a silent data plane or an unreachable deployment. Signals are
//! explicitly NOT incidents: no severity, no ownership, no paging here. Probes
//! write them, and an API will later read them.
//!
//! A signal with a given `dedup_key` that is already open (closed_at IS NULL)
//! is updated instead of being duplicated: the last_seen_at field is refreshed,
//! and the message is replaced. This invariant is enforced at the schema level
//! via a partial unique index on dedup_key WHERE closed_at IS NULL.
