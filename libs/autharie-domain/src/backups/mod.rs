//! Where an archive lives, and what may reach it.
//!
//! The rule this module exists to make unbreakable: a component holding one
//! deployment's archives cannot name another deployment's. Object stores have
//! no notion of a tenant, only of a string, and every cross tenant leak in a
//! shared bucket starts with a key somebody concatenated by hand.
//!
//! So a key is never written whole. An [`ArchivePrefix`] is derived from an
//! organisation and a deployment, and the only way to obtain an
//! [`ObjectLocation`] is to ask a prefix for one. Escaping upwards is refused
//! at parse time rather than resolved, because `..` in a key is either a bug
//! or an attack and neither deserves a best effort interpretation.
