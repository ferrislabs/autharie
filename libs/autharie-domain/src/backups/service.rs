//! Recording what a data plane says about an archive.

//! Two entry points and they are not symmetrical, which is the whole design.
//! An archive that exists becomes a row. An archive that does not exist

//! a backup that failed -- there is an attempt that was made, and the platform
//! keeps a record of attempts somewhere it already keeps records of work.
