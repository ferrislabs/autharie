//! Putting an archive back, into something new.
//!
//! A restore never touches what it restores from. It provisions a second
//! deployment, bootstrapped from the archive, on a hostname of its own -- so
//! there is a moment where both exist and somebody can look at the recovery
//! before anything depends on it. Moving the customer's traffic to it is a
//! separate act, and a separate version.
//!
//! That shape is not only for disaster recovery. It is what a change of offer
//! means, and what emptying a data plane means, because all three are the same
//! question: get this deployment's data into a new deployment, then decide.
