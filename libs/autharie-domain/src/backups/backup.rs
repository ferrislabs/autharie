//! What a backup is, and what it can be restored onto.
//!
//! One rule shapes the whole type: **a backup exists only if it completed.**
//! There is no status here and no failed variant. An attempt that did not
//! finish is an entry in `actions` and in the audit log, which is where the
//! rest of the platform already records work that was tried.
//!
//! The alternative looks harmless and is not. A row saying `status: Failed`
//! is a restore somebody will eventually attempt, and every function that
//! reads backups grows a check it can forget. Absence cannot be forgotten.
//!
//! The second rule is that an archive records what it can come back onto. A
//! physical backup is locked to the Postgres major it was taken from, and a
//! restore never goes to an earlier release. Both refusals live here rather
//! than in the restore path, because the restore path runs during an outage
//! and is the worst place to discover a rule.
