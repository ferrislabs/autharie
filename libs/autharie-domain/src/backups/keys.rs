//! Which key an archive was encrypted under, and how to get it back.
//!
//! Envelope encryption, and the reason for it is arithmetic rather than
//! taste. A key manager encrypts a few kilobytes per call, so it cannot
//! encrypt an archive; it encrypts the key that does. Rotating then costs a
//! rewrap of a few hundred bytes instead of rewriting terabytes, and
//! destroying a key makes every archive under it unreadable without touching
//! the bucket, which is the only deletion story that works when the archives
//! are immutable.
//!
//! The rule this module makes structural: **a rotation never rewrites
//! history**. Every archive records the key version that wrapped it, and a new
//! version is an addition. An installation that rewrapped in place would have
//! no way to state what a given archive was encrypted under, which is the one
//! question an audit asks.
