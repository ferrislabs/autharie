//! When archives are taken, and how much history is kept.
//!
//! Two independent answers, the way [`crate::upgrades::policy`] splits what
//! may be applied from when it may be applied. A cadence nobody set is not the
//! same as a retention nobody set, and collapsing them would make one of them
//! inexpressible.
//!
//! Retention is evaluated here rather than left to the object store. A
//! lifecycle rule deletes without leaving anything behind to audit, and
//! "which archives were removed, when, and under what policy" is a question
//! that gets asked exactly once, at the worst possible time.
