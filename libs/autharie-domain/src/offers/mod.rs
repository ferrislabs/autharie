//! What a customer buys for one deployment.
//!
//! Creating a deployment used to ask for a mode, three numbers and a
//! Kubernetes namespace -- five infrastructure decisions taken by the one
//! person in the exchange with no way to make them well. An offer is the
//! single choice that replaces them: it says how large the instance is and
//! whether it shares a cluster, and the platform derives the rest.
//!
//! A closed set, the way [`crate::backups::Cadence`] is. A customer writing
//! their own sizing is how a form field becomes a support conversation, and
//! the sizes here are the ones the platform can actually place.
