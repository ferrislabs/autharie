//! Moving which deployment serves a hostname.
//!
//! A deployment's hostname is `slug(name)` under its organisation's own
//! domain (#282) -- nothing else decides it. So moving a customer's traffic
//! from one deployment to another, without an outage on the only name they
//! use, is a name swap: the deployment taking over gets the name the
//! customer's hostname is derived from, and the one giving it up keeps
//! running under the name it is left with.
//!
//! Symmetric on purpose. Cutting back is the same swap with the arguments
//! reversed, not a second operation to build and defend separately.
