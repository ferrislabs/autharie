//! Distributing one certificate to every data plane's own Gateway.
//!
//! A data plane's Gateway terminates its own TLS -- there is no central edge
//! that could do it instead -- so every one of them needs a valid certificate
//! for `*.autharie.fr`, without holding the OVH credentials that would let it
//! prove that to Let's Encrypt itself. The control plane issues one wildcard
//! certificate centrally and hands it out instead, over the heartbeat: see
//! [`crate::dns::DnsProvider`] for the DNS-01 challenge this reuses, and
//! `autharie-api`'s heartbeat handler for where a certificate actually crosses
//! the wire.
//!
//! [`CertificateSource`] is this platform's own shape for "somewhere the
//! current certificate can be read from" -- a Kubernetes Secret cert-manager
//! already keeps current, in every installation running one today, and
//! whatever else stands behind this port on the day that changes. It only
//! reads: issuing and renewing is somebody else's job, the same way `autharie-s3`
//! does not create the bucket it archives into.
