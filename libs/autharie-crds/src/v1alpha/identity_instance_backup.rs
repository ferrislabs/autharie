//! Taking an archive of an instance, and asking for one on a schedule.
//!
//! Two kinds rather than one, because they answer different questions and have
//! different lifetimes. A schedule is configuration that outlives every archive
//! it produces; a backup is one attempt that finishes.
//!
//! Named `IdentityInstanceBackup` rather than `Backup`. CloudNativePG already
//! owns `Backup` and `ScheduledBackup` on these same clusters, and two kinds
//! sharing a name costs somebody an hour every time they type
//! `kubectl get backup`. The prefix also says the right thing: this is a
//! backup of an instance, which is its database plus enough of its spec to
//! rebuild it, rather than a backup of a Postgres cluster.
