//! Turning an instance's backup settings into what CloudNativePG understands.
//!
//! Everything here is a pure function from a spec to a resource. That is the
//! same shape as `edge.rs` next door, and for the same reason: what these build
//! is worth testing, and none of it is worth a cluster to test.
//!
//! The platform hands CloudNativePG the destination, the credentials and the
//! schedule. It deliberately does **not** hand it a retention policy. Barman's
//! retention is a time window and nothing else, so setting it to the
//! platform's window would delete the last archives of a deployment that
//! stopped being backed up -- which is precisely the case the platform's own
//! retention rule exists to protect. Deleting archives stays with whoever can
//! read both rules.
