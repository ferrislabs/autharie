//! Attributing an inbound OTLP push to the deployment it came from.
//!
//! Traces arrive pushed, unlike logs: nothing here asked FerrisKey to send
//! this batch, so the only fact to check is *where it came from*. The
//! answer relies on the same trust boundary log shipping already does --
//! whatever pod matches a deployment's own labels, in the cluster Herald
//! already has API access to, is that deployment (see
//! `infrastructure/logs/kubernetes.rs::selector`) -- read backwards here,
//! from a source IP to the pod holding it, rather than forwards from a
//! label selector.
//!
//! This trusts the TCP source address as the sending pod's own IP, which
//! holds for ordinary pod-to-ClusterIP-Service traffic on the CNIs Autharie
//! targets (no SNAT between a pod and a Service in the same cluster) but is
//! not a cryptographic guarantee -- deliberately paired with the
//! `NetworkPolicy` restricting this port to in-cluster traffic (see the
//! chart), the same way the log-reading path's trust boundary is Kubernetes
//! RBAC rather than a bearer token.
