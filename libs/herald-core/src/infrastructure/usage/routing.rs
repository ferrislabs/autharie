/// Keycloak does expose usage -- `keycloak_user_events_total` and the Quarkus
/// HTTP counters, on the management interface -- but neither is reachable for
/// an instance this platform creates: the operator starts Keycloak with
/// `start-dev --health-enabled=true` and no `--metrics-enabled`, and the
/// `Service` it creates publishes only port 80 onto the application port,
/// while the management interface those metrics live on is port 9000. Until
/// both of those change in the operator, there is nothing to read, and a
/// Keycloak deployment reports no buckets at all rather than zeroes.
