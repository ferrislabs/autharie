//! Publishing a deployment's own DNS record.

//! Two moments write one: placement, where the address is usually already
//! known, and deletion, which always removes it outright. A sweep beside the
//! server catches up whatever placement could not -- most often a dedicated
//! data plane that had not heartbeated yet when its first deployment landed.
//!
//! Best-effort throughout, like the object store and key manager next door:
//! an installation that never configured OVH gets no hostname for any
//! deployment, and one that did gets a hostname a little late rather than a
//! failed request.
