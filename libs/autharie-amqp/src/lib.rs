//! Connecting to the broker, and waiting for it when it is not there yet.
//!
//! Herald and Genesis start beside RabbitMQ in the same chart. On a fresh
//! install the broker is not accepting connections yet, and both processes
//! used to exit(1) and let Kubernetes restart them. That converges, but it
//! spends the one signal an operator has: three restarts on a fresh install
//! looks exactly like a bad secret or an unreachable control plane.
//!
//! A broker that is not up yet is an expected state during startup. A broker
//! that is still not up after the budget is a real failure, and exiting then
//! is right -- so the wait is bounded rather than infinite.
