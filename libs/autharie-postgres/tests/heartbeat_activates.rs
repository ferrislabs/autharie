//! What a heartbeat does to a data plane's status, checked against a real
//! Postgres rather than a mock.
//!
//! The rule this covers lives in SQL -- a `CASE` inside the `UPDATE` -- so no
//! domain unit test can reach it, and a mock of the driver would only assert
//! that a string was sent. This is the shape of logic that has to meet the real
//! engine.
//!
//! **Runs only when `DATABASE_URL` is set**, and skips loudly otherwise. There
//! is no Postgres in CI yet, so making it mandatory would turn every run red.
//! With one:
//!
//! ```sh
//! DATABASE_URL=postgres://autharie:autharie@localhost:5433/autharie \
//!   cargo test -p autharie-postgres --test heartbeat_activates
//! ```
