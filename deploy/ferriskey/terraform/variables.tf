    Password for the bootstrap admin account.

    Defaults to the value a local FerrisKey ships with. Anything shared should
    pass it through TF_VAR_admin_password from a secrets manager, and should
    follow the provider's two-phase guide rather than using the admin account
    for day-to-day changes.

variable "console_origins" {
  description = <<-DESC
    Origins the console is served from.

    Each one is expanded into the exact redirect URIs FerrisKey will match.
    It compares them as strings -- the `*` in a registered URI is stored and
    never interpreted -- so `http://host` does not cover `http://host/`, and a
    client library that appends a trailing slash is rejected. Both forms are
    registered rather than relying on a wildcard that does nothing.

variable "allow_self_registration" {
  description = <<-DESC
    Whether anyone reaching the login page may create an account.

    True by default because this configuration targets a local stack, where it
    is the only way to obtain a usable account -- see the comment on
    `ferriskey_realm_settings.autharie`. Set it to false for anything shared.
