# This replaces a script that drove the API by hand. The provider is FerrisKey's
# own, so it stays in step with the API, it manages the redirect URIs the script
# never created, and it converges -- which `ferris-ctl realm import` does not:
# that command creates, and returns a 500 on a realm that already exists.
#
# One thing still needs the API: at provider v0.1.0 `ferriskey_client.secret`
# holds "***", the mask the API returns in the client body, so the generated
# secret is read from the client-secret endpoint in scripts/bootstrap-ferriskey.sh.
