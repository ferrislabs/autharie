# The realm and OIDC client Autharie needs on its dedicated Ferriskey,
# declared rather than clicked together by hand. Mirrors
# deploy/ferriskey/terraform/, adapted for a shared production instance
# rather than a throwaway local one: self-registration is off, the console
# client cannot use the direct password grant, and there is no default admin
# password to fall back on.
#
# What this does NOT create: a static "herald-service" client. Autharie's
# control plane mints one client per data plane itself, using the
# REALM_ADMIN_* credentials in charts/autharie-control-plane/values-production.yaml
# -- there is no shared Herald identity to pre-provision.
